<h2>jack-abraham-long-wharton</h2><br/><br/>spk_0 : Thank you very much for coming today. You have to answer a question for me, though. You know, in law school, everybody sits in the back bench. No, Here everybody sits on this side of the room, this left versus right or something missing something. Is that close to the door? Because we all have interviews to go. Teo, we'll get you out in time. It's one of the things we try. Promise for you. We're delighted today, as opposed to a number of lawyers and others like me that you've heard speak before. We actually have somebody who's who's done it here with us today. Jack Abraham graduated from Wharton and in eight founder and CEO of milo dot com, which was acquired by eBay. And you're now director of local for marketplaces? Yes, on. Uh uh, let you describe it a little more, but this is something that, you know, I think has been definitely needed. I mean, how do you combine the online a ability to find stuff online with? Well, what's local? And where can I actually find it by it? So that's This is fantastic. Jack is has been named one of inks, thirty under thirty list of the country's coolest young entrepreneurs. He's also selected by Business Week was one of their best young entrepreneurs and also on fast company's list of a hundred most creative people in business for two thousand ten. If I can just do a couple of, uh, administrative things to remind you tutorial eleven, it's going to be the twenty eighth of October and it's going to be on brand building. We have a number of people from a smart design talk about building your brand, and I hope you join us. It's up here. Normally, we re rotate between here in Wilson's on scene today, the next one on the twenty eighth and the one after that, which I think is November eighteenth. The Friday before Thanksgiving will also be appear. That one will be on lemonade. I mean it just to remind you, Previous tutorials are online at any of these girls. Also, I think if you put in Wharton and entrepreneur into YouTube, you'd probably come up with some of them, and that'll lead you to the rest. We're also going to try something a little more formal than we have in the past. Hopefully, a wonderful my partners will be joining me. But we're gonna try to move over to the Dean's conference room and then for any of you have questions on legal aspects of starting a business or maybe something beyond that, the lawyers might know we'll have, ah, a little bit more formal Q and a obsession for an hour after this. Don't feel that you have to stay. But if you do have any questions or anything like that, we're happy to talk to you. Then it's over in the dean's conference. And I think that's it, not start talking. We'll get to the interesting part. So, Jack, thank you for joining me for coming to speak with us on Take it away.<br/><br/>spk_1 : Great. Thanks for having me. Really great to be here. I thought I'd spend today. I'm happy to talk about a little bit about my background and how he got to where I am just for context. But I really wanted to focus on basically helping get those of those of us here who have wanted to start a business but are kind of on the edge. And I've been thinking about it for a while. Hopefully go over the edge and do it And why. That's a smart idea on why. Sort of really focusing on your own idea. And what you're thinking about right now barely matters with a bunch of examples from some of the most successful companies that have been created in the past sort of decade. Um, I found all of those examples really helpful for me, and hopefully they'll provide some color for you and also be interesting. Um, so before, before I do that, I'll because I know I'm going to forget this, give you guys another reason to start a company before the end of the year. If you're thinking about it, which might actually lead you to the Legal roundtable, which is there is a very unique opportunity right now that's going to expire at the end of two thousand eleven. Where if<br/><br/>spk_0 : you start a<br/><br/>spk_1 : company and you invest in the stock of that company and it's what's called a qualified small business, so you know, low assets hasn't been around for a long time. So basically a startup, you have the opportunity to, if you hold that stock for five years and then you sell it after five years, have zero percent capital gains tax, which is crazy. After you sell on, the government comes and takes away a good chunk of your proceeds. It's really painful. So it might be something smart to do proactively if you are really thinking about starting something, so just I thought that would be good to get out there. And yes, good, good legal advertisement. So let me give you a little bit about my background. So I guess four years ago I was sitting in a classroom like this in an entrepreneurship class, sort of listening to the entrepreneurship lessons, and some were relevant, somewhere more relevant than others. Others weren't super relevant. And I was there with the front of mine, Zach Weinberg. And we just said, You know what? Why don't<br/><br/>spk_0 : we just try something? Let's just do do<br/><br/>spk_1 : this like, why are we in a classroom spending all of our time learning about it? Sometimes the best way to learn is through doing Let's just go and try something. We both had the actually both want to do something. So you know, we had, like, pretty good ideas, I'd say, but not nothing like knock your socks off at that point in time. So what we decided to do is we actually rented, eh? I don't I don't know if I quite want to say run down, but fairly rundown loft in the Northern Liberty Liberties in Philadelphia. And we just started hanging out there. We got some desk set up. We got some conference room space, and we literally had a row beds that we slept on every day for. Probably like a period of two months. We applied for the War in Venture Award, which gave us each about ten thousand dollars to kind of play around with. So we don't have to worry about money for the summer. And we start getting going. And no, I think what they were working on at the time. That Zach Wass and video advertising product for small businesses the idea was YouTube's getting really big like man, If you're a small business, wouldn't you like to reach all these consumers that are watching all these videos online? Seems like a reasonable idea. They start going down that path and sort of found no way. It's no way that that business is gonna work, too much cost in the equation and really hard to get the distribution you need. At the time. When I started, we were thinking about doing a sort of mobile shopping application. So this was before the days of Red Laser and anything like that. I this observation that, wow, these these phones have cameras in What if you could take a picture of a product at a store, take a picture of a bar code and get online prices for that product? I would not be really cool like seems like a pretty neat idea might be worth developing, man. So anyway, we both sort of went down those parallel pass. I found that it was before the APP store days, but we could develop the technology but getting people to download it, getting people to really use it. And then once they were using it. Once you've got someone in a store scanning a barcode, like figuring out how to make money off of that, it was pretty hard. Our initial thought was they're in the store. They're going to buy, they buy online. We can, you know, get a piece of the transaction from when they go online to buy and what we found. Wass people actually totally forget about that, and they go straight to Amazon or T Bay. Andi doesn't really give you a chance to get credit for the transaction, so we were sort of both in this position at this time. We're like, Oh, man, we wanted to start. These companies really isn't working out. But the great thing about it was we sort of got to Norse relative space is better. So for me, I got to know the shopping space a lot better have been poking around there a lot for them. They started really getting to know the advertising space. Um, remember, this was right around the time the Facebook platform opened up, and I remember it being like too am this loft and the Northern Liberties were up white boarding ideas and trying to figure out what to do, and they had this great idea for this social targeting algorithm. You know, like use the data of your friends on Facebook to target ads. Better to you and literally. The next day we were on a plane to California to talk to people about it was just very kind of rapid pace, just trying to give you an idea of what this environment was like. They they start trying to do that. I started thinking about doing like, a shopping website. Both of those didn't really end up working out super. Well, um, so But again, we got a lot more knowledge about the space is that we were in and Nan Zack said, You know what? Like display advertising seems really inefficient. It just seems like buying banner ads and then being untargeted and having to talk to all these publishers and do all this stuff that's kind of outdated. Um, at this point, by the way, they've gotten far enough, and I had to where both of our companies had surrounded ourselves with other really smart people who knew these markets a lot better than we did down. So they had the guy who, like, founded Right Media, which is a huge display advertising company that Yahoo bought for seven hundred million dollars or something like that. I've had a lot of people from the comparison shopping space, including Ferhat, who founded Shopzilla No gland Lodish, who invested. He's actually Warton professor who invested in diapers dot com early and a bunch of other, you know, really successful companies, and we were both learning. We were sort of taking it in, and then we sort of split passed from there. I moved out to Silicon Valley with my co founder, just decided all in going to go for this. We got an apartment off of University Avenue and just really start cranking on our ideas. And we really start getting close to what we felt like was a really big pain point, which is consistently across all of these applications that we were trying to build in the shopping space. We kept finding this problem that people were facing, which is man like it's great to shop online, but sometimes I just want to get it local. I just wantto see the product. I want to touch it. I want to feel it. You know, I might need it tonight. For some reason, it's really hard to get products fast online, and we observed this behavior, which was a lot of people, and we literally bring people in, have them shop in front of their computers and observe sort of what was missing. And there were literally people who would look at websites of retailers be like, Oh, man, that's a great product Where can I buy this? Like, who has this product in here? Me. How am I going to figure that out? I have to call every store nearby, and I have to, like, drive the store blindly and hope it's there. Or do I do the reverse where I go to the store, figure out what's there. Then I research it and then sort of triangulate and try to figure it out. So from our perspective, we said, Wow, that's a pretty big problem to solve For consumers. It's consistent. We noticed a pattern. We did our research on the space, and it turned out that this was not something local localized. The people that we were observing. It was a huge macro trend across the economy. So even today in two thousand eleven, there are like five percent of the retail sales in the country are done online. Ninety five percent are still done locally, ninety five percent twenty times the value. But what was really interesting that we found in our research was something like at the time. Thirty or thirty three, thirty five percent. Somewhere in that range of commerce was this behavior. People. They look online But then they buy buy in the store. So we thought, huh? Big market. Big pain point for consumers. That seems like something really worth going after and building. And the the biggest pain point. Of course. Wass, how do I solve this problem of man? That to call every store my gun have to drive around town to find these products? How am I going to do that? So that became our enemy. Just like the telephone, the phone call your ability to need to do the phone call. And we started thinking about what? Our things that we could do to eliminate your need to do that phone call. So we analyze the situation. So what happens when you call to figure out if approximate store you pick up the phone, you dial the number of your local best buyer wherever another human being picks up the phone, ask you what you're looking for and types it in the computer system. Why that happens. Like to me, that was just so weird that you needed humans when it's really you could just have a computer talking to a computer to find this information so well. We wanted basically to eliminate the the humans from that situation and set out on a mission of bringing the world's offline inventory online, focusing on real time inventory. So that same thing that the person is doing when you call them at the store just hooking into that computer system and making it searchable. I'm building a search engine where you could find these products, figure out who has what in stock and find the best price to. So, in addition to finding out who has it, oftentimes retailers will carry the same product. So giving you the ability to really make sure you're confident and you found the right price. So we we sort of hit this this idea and started running with it. We ended up raising money from some really amazing people in the Valley. This was actually two thousand eight, right? Won the stock market started falling apart, which is a very fun time to be building a business Yes, I remember. Like just to give you an example, was introduced to this guy key through boys. I don't know how many people know who keep this in the valley by people more in the valley. Now, keep your voice. So, Keith, um, was one of the early guys at PayPal. He was early at linked in one of the first investors and yelled from the first investors in YouTube early it slide, like, just behind so many in the papal Mafia. But call it out here, these guys that sort of founded PayPal and then went on to do great things. He just had so much experience building consumer Internet companies that I thought, Hey, it be great to get his advice. Didn't want to raise money from him how to raise some money from one lodish on the East Coast and his investment partner before moving west. And this guy, just like, would not meet with me, would not meet with me at all side thing. Um, you know, my friend worked for him and try to set up a meeting. Keith would say, You know? Sure, we'll meet. I'd respond. Great. What time? No spots. Narrow spots. Hey, Keith, like really looking forward to meeting soon. Love to pick your brain about what I'm working on. What? Just wondering. You know what would be a good time to meet their response? Thank you. I go up to the city and Pinky and say, Hey, keep swat, you know, I'm like up in the city near your office is like hanging out at the Starbucks. They just had a meeting here going to be hanging out, doing work for the rest of the day. Like if you want to, like, come by like that would be great. I love to buy a cup of coffee like no response. So eventually, like my friend intervenes. Keith, what are you doing? Stopping a jerk. Answer. Jack's email. So Keith response to me with three words. Where's your deck? Where's my deck? I don't want to pitch you anything. I'm not tryingto raise money from you. I just wanted to, you know, tell you a little bit about what we're working on and get your thoughts. No response. So my friend calls me up and goes, You better make a deck. Thank you. So I'm here, you know, Picture it's like ninety five degrees. And Paolo Aalto in this little apartment on University Avenue, sweating it out, building a deck for this new idea. Because, you know, this was something new. We discovered it wasn't the original thing. We raised money. And send it over to Keith. Keith goes great, got it. For the next two hours, he ripped it apart just toward to shreds. Every like, little piece of this business, just one liners back and forth over email. My favorite was, you know, he'd asked me a question. I responded with an idea of how it solved that, and he said, You have a better shot playing quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys, period. So<br/><br/>spk_0 : you know, put yourself<br/><br/>spk_1 : in my shoes. Here you are, like you moved across the country, left school early to, like, start a business. And this guy who's like, one of the gods of Silicon Valley, hate your idea and is ripping apart over email. But, you know, it was actually really instructive. I was really learning a lot from him, and he had some really valid points about how we were thinking about things in the market and stuff like that. So at the end of this two hour just exchange, I kind of sucked in my pride and said, Keith, thank you so much. It's been very helpful. I really appreciate it. I have tremendous respect for you and Max and the papal guys. I still really love to have the opportunity to think about these things. It's still really have loved to have the opportunity to meet up with you and buy you lunch or coffee says All right. Okay, fine. Like, let's meet this weekend. I respond. What time? No response. Sunday rolls around a key. It's going to be up in the city today. Like would really love to meet with you and chat with you about this stuff. No response. Finally, I get a meeting with him the next Thursday and at this point, because that actually worked out well, because I knew exactly what all of his sort of grievances were with what we're working on and thoughts. So I prepared, you know, taking my network of smart people that I knew in the tech world and really tried to solve a lot of these problems, Walked into the meeting, had a pretty focused agenda, said, you know, here, here, the things that I want to cover. I'm here that, you know, specific points in your e mails that I think are really worth discussing. And he goes, Well, wait, Let me hear the pitch. I said, Okay. And I pitched him. Milo, we actually didn't have a name for it yet. No. And within about five minutes, maybe ten minutes, he goes, All right, I want to invest. I said, I don't want your money. I didn't come here to pitch you. I'm not trying to raise money from you, he said. I don't care. You're going to take my money anyway. And I'm going to introduce you to Job Cream is the co founder of YouTube, Kevin Hart's. They do investments with me, and you should take their money, too, because you're going to need it. And don't you want more engineers involved off like all the stuff. So I thought I wouldn't mind meeting the cofounder of YouTube. That sounds pretty good. So was introduced to those guys start getting to know them. And they all liked it. They all wanted to invest. They do very few deals together. The only other one that they did around us was sort of airbnb. They do like one deal a year together through this special fund. That's their own money. And so I'm feeling pretty good. Get a term sheet from them. Terms are pretty good, but I'm a Warton student, so I'm gonna negotiate the price up. And then literally, the stock market just fell out of the sky just this week when we got the term, she literally the stock market went down over five percent every day Monday through Friday. So this was like that a week. I don't know if you guys remember this, but that week that was like the worst week in stock market history since like the Great Depression. So interesting time tto be raising money and but to these guys credit, you know who knows? Maybe they lost twenty five percent of their net worth over that period of time, but they still wanted to invest, and I took the money, actually ran a model figure out. Like, Should I take the money? Should I not? My model told me that with the adjusted probabilities of success, I should actually pay them to be involved in the company. So forget All right, I'll I'll take their money, Um, and from that point, you know, one of the things I negotiated Wass. All right, I'll get you guys involved. But what I want in return is I want to meet with each of you every Friday for an hour individually to go over the business. And I want to learn a lot from you. So the one thing I think I realized was especially after having spent some time here, you do learn a lot of school school. It's not the school's not valuable schools valuable, but there's so much mohr tto learn, especially in any particular industry. And the best way, I think tto learn it's surround yourself with people who have done whatever you want to do and spend some time with them. And that's what I did. So Keith was sort of your all amount all around anything related to start ups. He was just great examples, a lot of experience with it strategy product tiring, you know, getting users monetization. And he had experience with all these things. Kevin was pretty similar, but was particularly focused on. He's a serial entrepreneur. So a lot of the challenges that you face when you're a serial entrepreneur, how do you build a team? How do you raise money? You know, how do you find really great people? How do you motivate them? And then job really spent a lot of time with me. Damn products and technology and users. And how do you understand, like the data from users on your site and use that to inform the product decisions you make. So that was a really great sort of learning experience for me. And through that, we learned a lot that made the product a lot better. We learn strategies for getting users. We ended up replicating something that yelp had done early on and had that enabled us to go from like zero users to over a million a month in about a year, which was pretty good. And then basically before we knew it, we had a lot of retailers knocking on our door that wanted to participate in the platform. The network effects. Start going where we started with some retailers, we got some more users, chuck. More retailers attract more users to get a lot more users. We thought, Well, we can build milo dot com and Teo a pretty big property. Or we can plug this data and to like every major shopping site on the Web, because every company wants this data and wants to have this experience. So all these companies start coming to us one ofyou deals. We were doing deals with some of them young, and of course, a lot of them were also interested in acquiring the company, and I didn't really want to do that yet. We're really on a tear. The number of stores were adding, the users were getting the deals we were closing. We're pretty phenomenal. We had a lot of sort of interest from bigger investors in between that we had done around also at the worst time to raise money. They were like in a quarter to three early stage around Web companies that got funded. We were one of them. So right now it's crazy, like anyone can raise money. These were different times. Hey, and you know, started sort of exploring a lot of those options, but the team was growing. We probably had fifteen or twenty people at the team in the team, and we started doing this and hiring was going really well. We're really building a killer team and, you know, really thought about it. What started happening to us? One of the companies that was interested in potentially buying us really start heavily pursuing us competitively and like, basically copying a lot of what we did in the service, Yeah, and that was pretty difficult to deal with. We actually had information that Eric Schmidt, who's the chairman of Google, had sent a letter to their board basically saying that what we were doing was going to be one of the top three priorities for Google over the next five years. Which pretty scary. I think Google does a lot of here There. They try a lot of stuff, and usually if they try something in your space, it's not really that big of a deal When you have to be worried, I think is when they're super focused from the top down on something that can actually get it done and to a really good job of it. So that was a little bit scary for us. And then I'm at the same time, you know, some of these companies were doing deals with started approaching us and ultimately to sort of realize this bigger vision that we had bring all the products and all the shelves while the stores in the world onto the Web. We thought that eBay would be a great partner for that. So I ended up selling the business last December, and I am basically running local at eBay now, which spend an interesting experience in addition to running Milo with an eBay and I've been there for, I guess, ten months now. So that's sort of the background on me and how he got to where I am and hopefully a little bit of color, how it went along the way, yeah. So I'm happy, Teo said. The next thing that I love to do is tell you some stories about other companies that I think would be really interesting to you. But I want actually stop and take a a short break for any questions before diving into that. Any questions? Burning questions. Thanks. What? Yeah. So can you repeat the question just today? Actually thinking Yes. So the question was, in the early days, we had ten thousand dollars and we got a lot done. How do we get so much done? Or were there other funding sources that we were using and we ended up? You know, it's funny at that point, I was like undergrad in college, so my personal burn rate was very low. I could eat ramen, and I had a narrow bed and slept on the floor with my friends, and that was really so I had, like, no cost that I had to deal with. It was really just a question of service providers. So what we did with our law firm is we negotiated like a deferral of fees. So that's how we didn't have to pay the law from first in exchange for a small warrant that the law firm got so legal fees. That's how we handle that. In terms of people that we brought in, it really just depended on the person, like some people were more motivated by equity. So maybe you can pay them based on their contribution in some form of equity. Or, you know, maybe they just want to kind of be involved me. They want to check it out. And we had some people who are, for example, interning at that time who are sort of doing it for a very low cost, close to free. That's how we got it going when we had, like, no money, and then the point was to get to the point where we had enough that we could raise money. Man Lodish was sort of a mentor of mine while I was in school, so I went to his office and pitched him what we've had so far and he had brought hit one of his investment partners, and that was during boom times. So that was before all this stuff happened with the macroeconomy, and I walked away with, like, four hundred fifty thousand dollars after a few meetings. Now, the I didn't like just meet Len, right? I'd built a relationship with them, probably over a year and a half or two years, and had known him for a really long time. And that's actually what ends up happening when you raise money, really want to build a relationship beforehand. It's very hard, like raised money from someone you just met, Mom. You could do it and sometimes, and Silicon Valley's a lot like that. But in the East Coast, that was hard. So that's sort of We use the ten grand to get us to the point where we could raise something a little bit more substantial to go go bigger getting the first customer. So the the interesting thing about our business and a lot of great businesses have this problem is you have a chicken and egg problem, so you need something to get something. So E Bay is a good example. You need inventory to attract buyers, and then you need buyers to attract more inventory. Milo is kind of similar right, like needed stores to list their inventory. To get buyers. You'd virus get the inventory. So the way we started, it was similar toe How kayak started, which was we just built, you know, very complex, sort of deep web crawlers that index the data from the retailers. And, you know, we observed all of their like robots Don t X, t and all of this stuff, but that was what we used to sort of get going. And, yes, somewhat of a critical mass that could start attracting the buyers. And then eventually we got to the point, actually, where a lot of people had discovered us and start coming to us. So I guess we just struck a need that was so good that we didn't have to do a lot of, like, heavy business development in sales in the early days. Now we do. We have a pretty big business team of, you know, kind of seven really good this development people which obviously grew over time. But for us, we just kind of struck such a good need on both sides of the equation that we saw the chicken and the egg problem initially and then were able to get it to snowball from there. Yes. At one point almost hired a guy that I probably shouldn't have hired. And that might seem ridiculous, like hiring someone conceived a company in the early days. If you hire the wrong people into your company, it can, like, really changed the trajectory of the company. It could change. The culture can change so many things. At the time, we were sort of working around the clock, really tryingto work on the product, and this person was very much a like ten to five. He was pretty good. But I think that that might have changed our culture and might have caused a lot of problems. No. So we were very, very careful about hiring people, and it's unclear if we had chosen to hire him. If that would have shifted our trajectory because it was so early or not. Other things, I mean, we had some pretty bad stuff happen. Time, Yes, when we were raising money, but we managed to just go through it all. So the normal thing that you'd say in response to this question is O, the sky starts following and the sky actually did start falling, and we're still okay. No, I think The biggest thing is just persistence and having the tenacity to get through it. Come in. I don't know what other stuff sort of could have come up. Competitors could have emerged out of left field. For some reason. The retailers might have said, We actually don't like what you're doing. Retailers love. What we're doing is we're driving more business for that. So I don't know. I'd say I thought a lot about the team early on. I think you can make some mistakes with your team that that can cause a lot of problems. Yeah, that's a great question. I'll get into that. Actually, the second part of the talk and then if I don't answer it fully, can come back to it, but it's a really important question. Yeah. We surrounded ourselves with people who did that's as you can tell, sort of a theme like, especially when you don't have a lot of sort of credibility because you're just starting a business and you're young like you wantto surround yourself with other people who have done it before and have those networks and could help connect you with the right people, either getting them involved as advisors or as mentors or as investors. It's a really smart idea. One of the people that we got involved with as an advisor is the sky name to ditch our wall. Who was one of the early that's a Facebook? He literally he's such a great engineer and guy. He when it to Facebook is a story about him, went into Facebook, put on his headphones, and everyone at Facebook was like, Who is this guy like? He's not even saying hi, like, just like puts on his headphones, goes for the computer and just everyday from like morning until the time you went to sleep was Cody Cody. Just go and go and going. And then about two weeks later, he liked popped up and said, I'm done. I wrote our search engine. It's just one of those guys, like really, really smart guy ended up getting involved in the news feed and writing there like messaging, service and all sorts of stuff. But as a result of him being in Facebook, he had a great network for us and a lot of tips on that. So different open source projects that really good engineers work on or someone he had met that he thinks would be really good. And he'd introduce us to that. And then also he helped us set up programming challenges that for engineers, would let us, like assess how good an engineer is really difficulty, just based on a resume to figure out how good someone is and how good their code is and how fast they can work. So these challenges Facebook used them very successfully. We sort of used that method, and that proved to be very good. So we definitely didn't think of it as scraping. I mean, these were pretty, like sophisticated crawlers we build. We're indexing the data, but I mean, that's every business needs a way to sort of get started, and every business is different. And usually there's There's some exceptions there, some businesses where you just like start making money from day one, and that's the path you continue taking. And, like Lead Generation is a good example of a business like that where you're selling leads to some online education, sight or company. Basically, for the business to work, you have to start making money from day one. Both businesses, especially big businesses with big ideas. It doesn't work like that. You need to start somewhere, and you need to kind of have a strategy to get where you need to be. In our case, we needed to have users before anyone's gonna pay us, because what are they gonna pay us for? Like they're not going to sit and talk with us and do all this stuff a pretty natural conversation. I mean, after a while and you start talking to them, they assume that you want to be compensated for the revenue and sort of the seals. You're driving them. In our case, in the early days, there are some really easy things we could plug into that they already did. So they were already paying other companies per click when someone went from their website from the publisher's website to their website. They're already paying. SEPA is so a commission on the sale when someone bought on their Web site and a lot of them had by online pickup in store. So those are things that were easy that we could plug into immediately, and then in terms of the bigger sort of monetization and really charging them even for the offline portion, that's something we're we've already. I mean, we've been acquired, and we're still working on the measurement of that and really figuring that out for the retailer, and we've made a lot of progress. We were going to be able to do it, but that was enough of sort of a revenue stream in the beginning, get out. So I'm actually gonna continue if it's okay, just with the rest and then open up for questions again toward the end.<br/><br/>spk_0 : So I thought I'd be<br/><br/>spk_1 : useful. Um, so I said it in the beginning, sort of. Your idea really barely matters and getting started does address is your question. I think as an entrepreneur, if you want to start a company, you need Teo graduate to this stage where it's not about your idea. It's really about betting on yourself. And just your ability ultimately be successful in what you're doing. And I think that if you bet on yourself and you never give up, you have a one hundred percent probability of success. You hear that a lot from sort of people in the valley, and it's very, very true. So let me give you some examples. Who's heard of a company called PayPal. So when papal started out, papal Wass, initially a mobile encryption company, So Max Levchin had like seeing this need where it's really hard to crypt stuff over phones, he wrote this encryption software. They'd raised money on it. This was dot com boom days. You know, he had just graduated from University of Illinois was kind of going around the valley and that just was not working at all. Like not clear that that was a big market or a great idea. They start pivoting. They thought, Well, what if we could get closer to the money somehow? What about this idea of beaming money between Palm pilots? They created the software to tryto be money between Palm Pilot said they actually, famously Max, I realized, you know, I kind of need a CEO to run this. He contacted Peter Thiel, who's 1 of his early sort of angel investors to be the CEO. And Peter was helping with Essen. And this just really isn't working. This beaming money between Palm pilots. We need a big marketing stuff. We need a big marking sum to make this house. So they got the guy from Star Trek up on a stage, tried to invite media from everywhere and have spark, I think, spot like the real spot, like B money to someone beam a million dollars to someone that was sort of what was going on. And no media showed up to this event and they wasted a million dollars a million dollars, Just like first some marketing stuff. No, so, you know, like you tried this encryption thing that didn't work. You trying this Palm Pilot thing like that's not working at all. A lot of people would just give up and be like, Oh, man, maybe I should just get a job. I don't know where you go there and excite or something, but they didn't They kept at it and they thought, Well, maybe there's a way like to do this online. Maybe we can do it through email So they start making it about, like sending money through email. And that sort of worked, but not really. And then all of a sudden, they noticed people on eBay. We're using it like it's really hard to pay people on eBay in the early days. So that was a use case where they said, Okay, great, like huge pain point big need here. They focused all their energy on just invading eBay and making sure PayPal was used for all eBay transactions. And that was it. I mean, that's honestly what made the company. They grow on eBay's back. They sort of figured a clever way to get E based user base, and that was really what launched Papel into what it became, but they could have quit at any point along the way. They also had. I mean, there are so many things I'm leaving out of this story. They had a competitor. Ex dot com was started by Warton guy Elon Musk, who actually had an office across the street from them. We actually had pay files first office, so it's funny. Khun See? Like the window directly across the street, this other company competing with you, looking back at you. It's pretty funny, and they were copying each other, and, you know, there was a merger that was a disaster in the middle and like, Oh, you know, like Moritz joined the board and start shaking things up, and they had to switch their code base from something that was Unix based toe windows, and it's scaled only like one percent as well. And all the engineers were quitting. And like they had, they have like the Russian mob has figured out. How do you use PayPal toe like suck like ten million dollars a month out of the company. So, like ten million dollars being sucked out of the company every month. I mean, a lot of lesser people just would've quit and just been like, What the heck is this? The Russian mob's coming after us with this crazy guy across the street staring at me all the time, like crazy mergers. The VCs on my case, like, so deluded at this point, like we're going to just, you know, but they were a big success. Google sort of started as like a search for your business. Oops, company. So they created this Web site for Stanford initially, where they indexed all the stuff on stanford dot edu and built a better search engine for Stanford and Google. I thought, Well, this is great. Like maybe we can just do this for businesses. Businesses will probably need search on their websites. We've built this technology. We can set up a search engine for that on their websites, and that'll be great. That's what they raised money on. Everyone was like banking on them, doing that. They had a board meeting at one point where Larry and Sergey really wanted to take it to the consumer level. Their visas were screaming at them about No, you're never going to do that like there's so many entrench players like you're the seventh search engine. There's no way people are going to use this. You need to focus on make money and the business Mike more. It's like stood up at one meeting and slam shit on the table and was saying, You know, No, I don't know. I'm out of the company. Ram Sharan tried to buy shares and, like just all this behind the scenes stuff. And then there was stuff over Larry and Sergei. Could they be CEO? And they didn't like a lot of sort of turbulence and founding the business. Ultimately, they ended up doing it the consumer way, and that worked out. But that wasn't the initial plan, and there are a lot of people pushing against them to get there now. Another example is slide. How many people have heard of slide? Some not all slide into a building. All these Facebook applications and sort of games and widgets and things like that slide started as a slide show for your MySpace. So my space didn't have pictures for a long time, and Max saw this and said, like, Hey, what if we create this widget where you can upload your photos to slide? You could embed it on your MySpace profile, and then people can see it. Everyone ended up seeing it on other people's MySpace profiles. They started using it. It got like crazy traction. So many people were sort of viewing these photos and ultimately they made no money off of that, and my space wouldn't let the monetize that they try to kick him off the platform a bunch of times. They ended up migrating into Facebook. They got out of the photo sharing business. They got into sort of these interactions and some, like sort of lightweight games. A lot of sort of. It's not linear their their path to success. YouTube is another example. So YouTube and I obviously knows pretty well from talking about with job it about the early days they literally started the site as a video dating site. So the idea was as, Oh, man, like what? You have to go on dates with people, like going to restaurants, going to restaurants and, like, you know, the<br/><br/>spk_0 : first date, like, How do you<br/><br/>spk_1 : find people? And do you really need to go have coffee? Or like, what if you could just do it on the Web? You know, that seems to make sense, less of a commitment, you know, cause so anyway, so they try this idea of video dating, and they built this great side and no one was using it. Like apparently, they're great idea. Like no one was using the site. They tried invading Craig's list on, like pulling people off of Craigslist. They tried gift cards. They tried this. They tried that like all these things, no one was using this like it was, like two months in. They launched the product, and they were up to five hundred users for that<br/><br/>spk_2 : month. Come on,<br/><br/>spk_1 : five hundred and they were actually feeling pretty good about that because it's actually hard to get five hundred users believe. But what they started noticing was, Oh, man, like nobody's doing this video dating thing. But people keep uploading funny clips from Saturday Night live like, and people are watching that stuff. Maybe there's something there. They sort of start pivoting the product to be more about that, you know, uploading something in asynchronous communication, and eventually people just start uploading a lot of videos. They figured out that just like Max had exploited. Had exploited my space with the widget of your photos. You could imbed a YouTube video in my space. So everyone was putting these things on their profiles, and it just spread and took off overnight. So looks like an overnight success. But like very close to failure, you know, they thought about shutting the business down at certain points. They couldn't raise money for that because nobody wanted to fund like not to mention the lawsuits that came in after. And it's all this stuff. So YouTube, you keeps another example of where the idea barely mattered. Getting started in another one is Airbnb, who's sort of airbnb recently. So Airbnb is interesting company. Run out your space. So if you like on an apartment and have an extra bedroom, you Khun listed and people could stay there instead of staying at a hotel. Come airbnb. What sea really started on this observation of like these guys were trying to figure out howto get going in entrepreneurship. They're going to all these conferences like entrepreneurship conferences, and they kept going to conferences. And there were, like, no hotel rooms available because conferences suck up all the availability from all the hotels, so they actually started selling aero beds effectively for conferences. This was the initial idea. Aargh! Beds for conferences where you could, like, crash at some place on a narrow bed because there were no hotels available. That was their market. That was like what they were addressing, you know, overbooked conferences with Arab ETs. Airbnb. That's kind of how you a little bit of I'm related to the name. They also, you know, start. They figured when Obama was inaugurated, that would be another one that would like overbook hotels. They try to do in D. C. And they literally had no funding. So what they did wass. They created the cereal box boxes over Captain McCain's and, like Obama, chose so literally a cereal box with these presidential candidates on it, Mom and like different types of cereal in it, and they sold it to people in D. C. And that's how they got there. Like seed money. I'm not even joking. That's what kept the business alive, just totally not related to their business. And then, you know, they start sort of realizing. Well, what about you need to stand a narrow body stand a couch. If you could stand a bad, maybe you could. I have a whole room. Maybe you could even have a whole place to yourself and they kind of got bigger and bigger, and it's a huge company announced doing really well. Groupon is another example who's sort of group on. Okay, guess what Groupon started as start as a site called point. Um, it was about like, rallying people around your political ideas. It's not related to group buying at all. So you go there, and I have actually haven't used that site, but the point site. But it was supposed to be like you create these issues and try to get people to back them and get a lot of momentum behind you so that it's a terrible idea, like nobody was really using the site and not really a big market intuitively. But what they did notice was some people on the site we're forming groups to do group by. So hey, like people in Chicago, Illinois, you know, that salon that's really good. And, yeah, that that woman there's really good. What if, like, twenty of us got together and maybe she'd give us a discount. They started just seeing this behavior develop on the site, and they thought, Well, that's kind of interesting. Um, and then they started thinking about, Well, what if we were sort of the advocate for the consumer and we promise merchants a lot of business. Maybe they dropped the price for everyone and we could create this model of what became Groupon send them emails about. Sort of wildly successful there. You know, some people have. I know it's in the news a lot for not being such a great business. But other people who know the numbers have said it's the fastest growing business like ever in Silicon Valley. So started as this. I called the point about sort of debating political views. No, livingsocial started, as I don't know, some app on Facebook that you would use where your spot was like, get together with your friends and do social stuff. They obviously copied the Groupon model to go after them. And even some Warton startups. So let me tell you about some board and start ups where this happened. So Zinga, who knows Inga. So Mark Pincus started that he's ah, Warden alum. And there's one other guy from Warren. They're in there, too. Sorry. Yeah. A j a J Trader. Trader? That's right. So when they start off, they just start going after poker. They felt like, Oh, poker. Poker is going to make sense on Facebook, like you're sort of trading money. You're gambling on Facebook. You know, there's got to be some way, sort of build that into a business and make money off of it, and people started playing the poker thing, but they really never made money off of that at all. To this day, they make a little bit of money off of it, but it's like a tiny, tiny, tiny part of the business. It turned out that these things like Farmville, where you come back and invest a lot of time, and there's sort of inapt purchasing a virtual goods. This was the model that worked. Guess what? He didn't build Farmville. He bought it. He started buying these companies. He, you know, had some capital because he had raised money from VCs. And I ended up buying that company and bought a lot of the other ones. That became really big successes for Zynga. Eventually they got it, and they have studios now that sort of turned these things out. But the initial thing of like poker on Facebook. Not a big business like not something. Not the best thing to bet on. And he's started a lot of company, so you can see how sort of hard this is. StubHub Jeff lawyer won't tell you this, but it started as this company called liquid tickets. So he approached this as any good finance guy would. Which is, Let's look at verticals where people are buying stuff. Let's find the highest sergeant thing and just try to build a business there. That's literally how he did it. He's from Blackstone and very finance. Heavy guy tickets turns out, are very high margin. So he tried to create this business where he noticed there were a lot of seats that were going unfilled in stadiums. And he tried to sort of partner with the stadiums to sell that inventory day off. And nobody, that was like a really hard thing to do. But nobody wanted to partner with them. Nobody really wanted buy it or sell it. There are all these legal complications. He went on doing that for like, two years, and it just didn't work. And then he sort of evolved it and noticed there was a need for people to directly trade tickets over the Web and founded StubHub, and that did really well, and now it's a big part of eBay, actually. Talk to you about invite media. Those guys I was talking about in the early days who did, like the video ads, start up in the social targeting startup. They ended up building this thing totally different in the display at space that revolutionized display advertising, and Google ended up buying them. Mom Shopzilla started as this thing where you could rate online e commerce sites and give reviews on them wasn't about comparison shopping or buying products. It was really hard. It got to the point where for hot at one point, like everyone had quit on him and he ran out of money. And he was. It was one guy was him, like in an apartment, working on this by himself, like wishing there was a job, as he says, some Caterpillar job at the company Caterpillar that he could just take. And, you know, eventually he found will actually, in the comparison shopping model. That's a really big space and sort of pivoted into that. And it became a big business, I think, was sold for seven hundred million dollars or something. Um, and even for Milo. So you've heard the story from Milo, too, of how we sort of started with something that was totally different, and I got a bunch of ideas. There's some that I even left out, and there that we tried, that really didn't work. So the point is just fricking<br/><br/>spk_0 : do it like, what are you<br/><br/>spk_1 : waiting for? You know, if you if you just wait and you over analyze your idea, you're never gonna have the opportunity to discover these big things in the market. It's just not how it works. Like it's very, very rare that someone just into its by themselves in some room alone, this amazing idea that's going to change the world you'll probably into. It's something that's pretty close, like in the right area, in the right market. No, there is a need, for example, to exchange tickets online. That makes a lot of sense. There's inefficiencies in that market, but the initial solution was like, totally wrong. No. So the point is to just get going just started. Like, if you don't start it now, you're probably never going to start it. You're gonna end up having a job, and then you're gonna end up, you know, making some money on DH. That's not a bad thing, but the problem with it is you're going to get comfortable and you're not going to be able to sleep on a narrow bed and have Rahman. You're going tohave, you know, serious girlfriend who, like, you know, wants to go on vacations and all of these things all of a sudden life starts getting a little bit more expensive and it it becomes harder to take these risks. I think so.<br/><br/>spk_2 : All right,<br/><br/>spk_1 : you know, it's better toe. They're clearly people who can because they've saved. It's another approach that people have taken, but sort of The sooner you start, the less you need, the more you can really throw yourself into it. So you really do have an advantage of just just going for it. So why is it that this hat like, why does this phenomenon exist where so many big, successful companies in Silicon Valley and around the world started with something else? The first thing is, like I said, I think it's very hard to just into it, this masterful product and come up with the exact version of it on day one. Some other ones I left out there by the way like Twitter start as an SMS thing between people like There wasn't a site twitter dot com. It wasn't about sharing news and photos and links, and none of that yelp actually started as an email thing, where you try to send out an e mail to your friends and get recommendations for local like places that didn't work. So just so many, I could go on and on and on and on about all of these these companies, it's really hard, even if you're really, really, really smart to just come up with with a brilliant idea on Day one. So the best thing to Dio is surround yourself with people who can learn from who can be your mentor's. Because, believe it or not, like I still have everyone still has a lot to learn. Like there's so much to learn and surrounding yourself with those people and getting them on your side, either as an investor as an advisor or mentor, can be really helpful to you. You can learn a lot from them And then what ends up happening is you put yourself in the space and you learn about sort of adjacent opportunities. So Josh Compliment is also working alone calls it a heat seeking missile, like the best entrepreneurs Air Heat seeking missiles on DH. That's another sort of way to think about it. The one thing that I would say when you are considering that is sort of important is the market you pick to go into so you either want to go somewhere where you can have massive, massive amount of users that are really engaged or in a market where there are lots of transactions taking place. There are some things you Khun build that like aren't in either of those camps and those are the ones that are really hard to build into businesses. But as long as you start off in one of those two areas and you're flexible on you surround yourself with really smart people and you really get to know the market pretty well and you never give up. You're going to be successful. It's just sort of the way it works. So hopefully this is helpful sharing my story and some of the stories from these companies happy to turn it around for questions, yes. What? Yeah. So I'll walk you through my process. Step one for me, Wass man comparison shopping sites like Shop, Sylar making a lot of money and their sights sucks. And it's a messed up market for a lot of reasons that I could go into for a very long time. But there's a need for there to be good shopping sites on the Internet because people buy a lot of stuff and you can build really big businesses there. That was it. That was the beginning. Like there's, you know, Amazon and eBay or great. They've truly are really amazing businesses. But I had a hard time believing that was it. So that's where I started honestly, and then at the time, you know, I think one way to think about businesses is like, really good businesses. What's possible today that wasn't possible three years from three years ago. And what's changed so clearly. One of the things that was changing was mobile. A lot of people are getting these smarter phones and starting to use them, and you have cameras and phones. You've never had that before. People were using them for not just phone calls, for starting to browse the Web seem like APS were pretty obvious to be next. So that was an area where I spent a lot of time thinking from early on. Another thing Wass sort of said That was the initial the initial idea we had and then just giving you an idea of sort of the next approach. We talk as we thought, all right, it's really hard to get people to download stuff. One of the things we learned in marketing class Wass The hardest thing you can do is change consumer behavior. So figure out a way to get in front of the consumer and some normal process they're already going through. So people at the time weren't in the process of downloading apse on smartphones. It just people didn't do it. They do it now. They didn't do it then. So we thought, Well, what people normally do and they shop. They go to Google or they go to Amazon or they go to eBay or they go to shop. Sylar, they'd go to all these other sites. Seen that. So my next thought was What? Is there a way we could be there like, Could we be there because there are already there, and I thought, Okay, how can we get there? We'll one ways we could do business development. Well, that's not gonna work because nobody's gonna want to do business with us. We have nothing. So why would they? Then I thought, Well, is there another way to do it? Maybe you could create a brat, something in the browser that would detect when they went to sites like Google and search for products or Amazon or seen it. And maybe you could create technology that would just overlay the information in the page without their sort of permission. And that way you could do it across all the sights people were going Teo, and then I have to change their behavior. So we start building that. And that's what we raised our money on initially, this sort of concept. But we ended up finding that people really don't like downloading that. They were afraid of spyware because there were all these old things that didn't try to build a good product and screwed users and popped up ads at them everywhere. And people were really wary of downloading anything, having to do online shopping on their computer and installing it. So then we thought about, Okay, if that's the problem getting users, how can we change that? How can How can we start getting users? So I thought, Well, maybe there's a way. If people aren't like just downloading this outright, we can either pay. That's one option. You can get it installed with other stuff. And then if we make more money than we're paying to acquire users, the business turns out you have to pay a lot to be able to do that for user. And then you have this bad incentive where you've paid a lot of money. So you really want to monetize you create a bad user experience where you have to pop up the ads of people to make your investment back. So I thought, Okay, well, you know, the best way to get users for free is to create something viral. And what are some viral things that we could build into this that would make it spread on its own At the time, Facebook was huge. Everyone is using Facebook. So I thought, Okay, what if we brought in this and shopping's the way we monetize, and that's the really interesting part from a business standpoint. But what if we made it somehow, like tied to Facebook so we could get it viral? And the one thing that was missing from Facebook, it was instant messaging. So this was before Facebook chat, so can't tell where the story's going. I thought, This is great. We're in the browser, weaken like create this cool instant messaging with Bridget in Facebook. Everyone's going to use that. Nobody likes, like Amy and all these other services. We can mine all of their friends, contact info from their front profile pages, build them, eh, A chat client. And then that would be so cool, everyone would use that. And then, after every I am is sent to someone on another network will advertise the the chat and the sort of plug in that you could use, and people will come and download it because it's going to be really cool. Turns out I was right. Like Facebook. Chat needed to exist like synchronised communication on Facebook made a ton of sense. But Facebook built it like right when we were almost done with launching the product like literally, When we're almost done, I actually had this painful experience of meeting the engineer that built it for lunch. Like the day before, it was going to launch side some friends on Facebook, and it caught wind of this. Turns out great idea, like tons of people use it might have worked, might have been viral. We might have gotten thirty, forty, fifty million people like downloading and using this, but our window has closed. So then it was like, All right, yeah, how else can we get users that are free and how do we get them fast? And that's where when I really started learning from Keith, Kevin and Job in about other things that had worked and yelp had the same problem. How do you get people to start using yelp? And they had found that on Google, there's a huge gap in Google's index for location plus restaurant, that key word. But a lot of people are searching for it. They just started creating pages that were created to rank for those terms. So again, no changing consumer behavior. They found it through Google. They found it after finding it a few times, they come actually directly to help tease the service up. So What about location, plus product? Maybe. Maybe that'll work. You know, like people probably probably search for that. Some people a lot of people probably don't because the results are so bad. But we started creating pages optimized for those keywords, and we got pretty good at it. And that's how he got our initial sort of set of traffic. And once you start getting all of those users and things are really growing, you can keep going. Makes no more sense tow tryto change, change the idea. But the goal is ultimately, at least in consumer Web, to get scale like you need to get a lot of people using it, and you basically need to keep trying things until you find the way that works to do. Hopefully that's helpful thinking through that the thought process. Yeah, I mean, it's very simple, like people are going to expect to have access to information of anything that exists anywhere in the real world at a moments notice from their phone. So the big thing that we're focusing on, that's still a big pain point. We've made a lot of progress, but we still have a lot more to make is what's available, where and for what price and who has the best price cause that'll influence where I go, the time I spend the direction I take and how much money I spent. So we're focusing on that. We're focusing on being able to measure that. So when someone does a search on Mobile for the Web and goes into the store, being able to kind of measure that six seamlessly and give people rewards for using the service is going to be really big. You see a lot of interesting innovations and payments and local, too, and you'll start seeing some stuff from PayPal, too, that we're working on it probably can't comment on too much of that. It's an exciting time, I think you know market, Greeson wrote. This article called Software is eating the World, and I think it's true just every sort of industry and segment of the economy is just going to be influence by the Web and technology, and it's happening now for local really fast fighting. Um it's really Yeah. I mean, it's really hard to find the right technology partners. It helps. If you're the more technical you are, the easier it isthe. It's sort of hard, tio. The thing after, like engineers, especially good engineers have a lot of options of things they could do and spend their time on. And they could create their own stuff. They could create their own company. So why are they going to work with you? A lot of people, I think that worked. Unfortunately sort of treat. I'm not saying that you're doing this at all. Treat engineers as code monkeys. Hey, I had this great idea. I worked at some consulting firm, and that makes me, like, really smart, and you need to do my idea and like, sit in the basement, I'll give you pizza and like, I'm going to give you like no stock in this and Lopez and just It doesn't work like that, like, you need to find someone. You need to sell them on the vision on what you can provide. So that could be business development. It could be product. It could be recruiting. It could be investors. You know, you really need to convince them that you're a good partner. You're going to put in a lot of work, too, and you need to give them like meaningful equity because they're not code monkeys like they can make and break the company, um, and in terms of finding them. So that first step, No, you just need to try everything like honestly. And the thing is, it's just like raising money. You should try it. You should have the goal of building a relationship instead of like selling them on joining your company the first time you meet. It's really hard. These people, they probably are working somewhere else. They have another job. They have, like their own life. So they're not going to just jump from that to your idea because you just kind of showed up, So the best way to do it is to meet with them and get to know them. And like for John, my co founder, I worked on him for probably six months before he initially joined. I mean, he's really good guy, and he was working on his own start up at the time, but I was just persistent and kept up with him. So you just need to do that. You need to start taking people out to lunch and coffees and and, you know, anyone who knows just exhaust all channels, basically It's really hard, obviously, because everyone's looking for create technology people. The other thing I'd say is I know a lot of people at Warden are afraid of this. But coding is not that hard. It's really not that hard, like were logical people. It's just logic, like it's not that hard. You can learn it and the advantage of learning it is you'll have a lot more control over your product and you'll get more respect from the engineers, which will be great. So it's a great I mean softwares. Eating the world, like knowing how to program is going to be really important. And it's just not that hard. You can get a website like if you if you put yourself in a room for a week and you like Google's like great sights to learn to program or search on Cora and you use them for a week, like at the end of the week, you could get something done in like a month. You'd be pretty good. So imagine, if you had done that a month ago like you'd be in a pretty good place. No one wants to do this.

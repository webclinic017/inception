<h2>affirm_seven_samurai</h2><br/><br/>spk_0 (0m:0s) Welcome to the eighty six teensy podcast. I'm Michael Copeland. Max Levchin helped build PayPal. Then he went on to tackle gaming at slide. Now he's back in the world of payments and finance with his latest startup, Affirm a sixteen z's Angela Strange talks with Levchin about affirms opportunity in the world of finance and how it aims to build trust among a customer based that doesn't trust banks. Why building models around loans requires making bad loans. And finally, why everyone should start watching. Curious. I was seven samurai Over and over. Angela Strange starts things off. Why<br/><br/>spk_1 (0m:41s) don't we start by talking about the firm and payment's finance an area that quite complex that you spent a long time in and oftentimes entrepreneurs that have built successful companies in one space say, Hey, that's that's enough and you made a foray over to slide. And now now you're back. So what is it about the idea for a firm and affirm specifically that really got that passion that I need to spark this that I need to solve this problem?<br/><br/>spk_2 (1m:11s) There are two parts to that question. One is sort of why back to finance and my wife explain it to me. I couldn't actually figure out what went wrong with slide, which did very well financially, but was never quite thie. The real catch for me and firm as yeah, I'm I'm wallowing in my my daily pleasures of running this company and she unfortunately, I think I don't know. She meant that as a compliment. You say you're a very serious person. Spend most of your formative years building a payments company that became the payments company on the Internet. And it was a very serious task and fought fraud. And it was great. And then you went off the deep end and have to build a games company and look at you now, back to serious things like that. You are just not that guy who makes funny games. So I'm probably back where I belong, at least according to her. And I tend to agree the kind of more interesting question. Why'd this part of payments? Why this part of sort of Syria's universe and the answer? There is the fight of score that drives the credit decision ing. It's essentially proxy for how much limited going to get. If you're gonna get a credit card. What terms are going to get all the different decisions by even the most sophisticated lenders and banks are largely driven through this magical number called the Fighters Core, which was invented in the eighties or even late seventies and has really not changed. That much certainly has not been adjusted for the notion of the gig economy that was invented well before. People change their jobs more than a couple of times per lifetime. And so there is always this moment when it would start creaking under the changes to the world we live in. And it really hit hard right after two thousand, a financial crisis because young people that were coming of age entering the workforce starting to consider their first contemplated purchases, I would say Oh, this fighter score and then they surely know what the name was. But they say, Why am I getting these terrible rates? Why can't I borrow money? Why do I have to get a credit card where I can't even understand, let alone calculate with the ers, as I was sort of watching all this stuff in the reading, the research on it Because serious person, I read this kind of research before bedtime. I start to think that there's probably an opportunity to just build a bank of the future for all these eighteen plus year old people, which is how we were went up with her.<br/><br/>spk_1 (3m:38s) So talk specifically lots of different ways that this problem could be tackled from lending clubs. On the consumer side, there's bunching on back. On the business side, you've chosen a pretty specific angle at a firm talk. What is the firm do? Exactly<br/><br/>spk_2 (3m:52s) so firm, first and foremost is a purchase finance service. What we do best today is integrate at the online and just launched offline literally a few weeks ago. Point of sale where as a typically a young person comes in and says, I would love to buy this amazing looking Casper mattress on casper dot com, it is a bit expensive. It's one hundred dollars, and that's not really something I'm going to put on my debit card. And I don't have a credit card because I don't want to have a credit card. I could do it, but I just don't trust these guys.<br/><br/>spk_0 (4m:23s) And so I'm going to go<br/><br/>spk_2 (4m:24s) home. I'm going to be a window shopper and probably gonna wind up sleeping on the floor for an extra couple years until they noticed that on that page, it says, or you can split it into six payments. As low as probably, this case will be a along the lines of hundred and something dollars trying to count. There's a lot of restriction to what you can and cannot say. So I'd rather not be quoted to Miss Mr Putting my Own Tribe by mattresses You absolutely should want for one of our favorite merchants of Casper. And so you notice that there is this extremely obvious, transparent, generously framed payment plan. It's available on Casper, and it resonates beautifully. Was thie young shoppers mind where they say, Oh, no card, no complexity. The interest is pre calculated, very important. We've disclosed the interest both in the rate and dollar terms. The approval is instant. There's no weird Hang on while we go in play around as your credit rating. We don't do a heart poll is they call it in history, so you don't really don't ding your credit record, figure out what the rate will be and disclose it very clearly and then you agree, and within twenty four hours, Caspar tells you, OK, it's on the way or within seconds because they get from us a notification that we approved alone and it goes so we basically help people finance thes considered purchases something north, a couple hundred dollars all the way out to several thousand dollars, and it's grown pretty significantly this point. We have several hundred merchants live and several hundred more integrating it's Ah has a pretty amazing impact on the merchant themselves. We see about a thirty percent increase in sales for most of these merchants, really all about window shoppers converting into buyers by way of saying, I can't afford a thousand dollars overnight, but I can certainly afford eighty dollars payments over the next year or so, or year and a half. So that's Ah, that's been our bread and butter for for a year in a little bit now, and we're just starting to branch out into the next set of services in our plan to build a sort of comprehensive financial system for the young people.<br/><br/>spk_1 (6m:30s) You talk a lot about young people, and you've been you've been the one that's been toting a lot of these stats and just some of them and think they see banks is completely undifferentiated. Millennials would rather get their financial services from anybody except for one of the banks. The really surprising stat to me was that two thirds don't even have credit cards. And then, generally they just hate these brands. Did you think that there's an opportunity to build a new brand? It's not that they hate bank brands all the time indefinitely. It's that they don't like the's bank brands and are really looking for what's that next thing that's going to be fast, transparent, mobile, some of the characteristics of a firm that you talked about?<br/><br/>spk_2 (7m:12s) Yeah, I think that is the opportunity. I think the opportunity of the day is to build this nice loan book. We have very sensible side of merchants, A lot of very cool, young start of merchants. You. This because it resonates well, was their customers. But the launch opportunities to really build a trusted brand that speaks to what the young people expect because they don't expect anything good from, you know, filling your favorite top ten back there that one of the best stats is Ah, in the millennial disruption in next study, which was a giant survey. They think for fun. Basically said, You know, Lister, top ten most despised brands top for one of being banks, so they're they're definitely not well liked. And they're a couple of a couple of reasons for it. Number one. The notion of you have to go to a branch to do certain things is completely anathema. Teo. A lot of people think of convenience these days, but to kind of in a more sour or darker note. A lot of these people were in their formative years in two thousand eight, and they witnessed what happens when the bank of that scale is squeezed by their own bad decisions. Governments about decisions. It doesn't matter whose fault it was. Ultimately, many of them didn't stand behind their customers in a way and that they had advertised or talked about. And so as these houses were getting sold short as their credit card limits were cut, this people were being told. Sorry, we're going to have to pull your line even as the consumer one of that line the most. They walked away with a pretty strong muscle memory of that's not your trusted partner. The corner bank is not really the corner bank. It's gone national brand, and it's it's just not on our side anymore. So I think that that's the opportunity we're really looking at today to build the equivalent of a great American bank for the next generation. Interestingly enough, there really two brands that survive to banking brands of survived two thousand eight financial crisis really promotion tacked. One is American Express, which I think is probably one of the best financial institutions out there. But they have not figured out how to market to young people at all. There's really not that much cool left in the black card. Ifyou're in eighteen year old and the Zen master and have success with these arrests are issuing. Banks have successfully chipped away that by issuing their own visa black and like sapphire cards things like. But the other one, that's fascinating, kind of a spiritual guide. Light for us is Yusa. They're far less known, but they're the armed forces serving bank, and they gained custom attraction during the crisis. They stood behind their customers, no questions asked. They would help people refinance loans even if they were in dire straits, They would give them incredible treatment during the time people will lose their jobs or have to deal with some sort of personal tragedy. And even though they probably lost short term revenue opportunity, they ultimately made an unbelievable number of people very loyal to them. So every time we start asking ourselves what is the right next branding move for us? We search for a precedent in U. S history.<br/><br/>spk_1 (10m:4s) Let's talk. Talk a bit more about that many of you seeing the stats and I think there's been something like thirty billion dollars of financial capital that's gone into the Fintech space in the last two years. We are. We're proud investors of proud investors of a firm. One of the one of the popular terms right now is dis aggregations of the bank, and you can see a lot of thes images on Google. Look for Bank's website point Teo. Any product that they offer, and you can see five to ten new start ups that are hitting each area. Take wealth management you've got the term now is robo advisers. Instead of paying to your financial advisor a larger percent. You pay a small man to an automated robot that will put you in funds that don't cost us much. If you want to go for your consumer alone, there's a bunch of different cos he'd go there. Business loans, a bunch different there. You could imagine this world where every time you want something different financially, you're going to a totally separate company. Or there's a world where, like, affirm your starting with point of sale lending. You've moved into student lending. Do you see that banking is going to progress? Is really a big desegregation or that its just starting as being desegregated. But someone's going to come out on top and build a really trusted brand and be able to provide more and more of those services.<br/><br/>spk_2 (11m:24s) So I think both things will actually happen. The search. Google Find Service Fulfill Service is a very trans, actually, really oriented relationship. If you need to refinance freezes in credit card debt, it behooves you to shop for a good rate. And Google is get a shopping tools, as you can find these days. So, or perhaps more specialties was like Creditkarma. You would go in search for a provider that would make you feel like you're getting a good deal. It's not something that happens all the time, and you don't really hopefully don't refined, answer correct our debt all the time. And so once every and months or years, sort of event, I can see that being permanently deconstructed into these extremely efficient, very thin once transactional service. And then you're done and you feel very good about sort of satisfy you need. There's definitely going to be several probably winners that take the spot in your brain that belongs to Wells Fargo. For your parents, the sort of a place where your money goes into a direct deposit account of some sort that takes care of your billing mostly automatically accept they very poorly. That's where you get your card. That's where you get. Your checks are probably hopefully going to go away. But the the modern equivalent of a checking account essentially automated bill paying it will happen from that. And I think that's going to be something that will probably remain a branded monthly weekly relationship, something that happens to be a part of your life. Now the interesting opportunity there is if played correctly. And we're certainly in competition for that. The opportunity there is not just to be the thing that's in your head and you're using it everyday. But the thing that in your head that you know is your trusted advisor is actually your helper. And then that may well be the jumping off point for, you know, where do I get my best terms for credit card refinancing and the efficiency of those services might still propel them forward in their own little transaction, Always. But you probably would start in a place where you have the trusted relationship and also where your money goes from your paycheck. So that's thie. I think that that that's really interesting opportunity. That's also where we're playing.<br/><br/>spk_1 (13m:41s) One of the things I think is really special and unique about a firm is how you're fitting into what we like to call the on demand economy. We used to live in this world of planned purchases. If you wanted anything, you needed to think about it at least a week in advance. And now, with your mobile phone, you want a taxi you call uber. You want food you two hundred different cos you can deliver a meal in fifteen minutes. There is actually four different startups that will come fill up your car with gas on demand now moving to a fairly, like large extreme Andi think with finance. It's also moving that direction. And you talked a bit about it about I'm going to go buy my mattress. Oh, shit. It cost a thousand dollars. I'm not going to buy my mattress. Affirm to the rescue. You've just moved into student loans. It used to be. I'm going to plan for for your college is now. I can take a three month coding boot camp. I don't have three months to plan for loans. I need my money. Right. Then how do you think about like being customer acquisition? Being at that critical point of need as part of the establishing that relationship with customers versus trying to drive people into a branch The old school way,<br/><br/>spk_2 (14m:49s) right? So that that's entirely essential to how our growing, how we're what we do, the partnership we have with our merchants. And at this point, that's a very stretched definition, because alternative learning platforms are merchants in our system, and we've all kinds of other interesting verticals that we're working on. But the provider of service or product that encounters that consumer typically tells them about us as they're considering a purchase. In most cases, THIE conversation doesn't start on the checkout page. When they say, Well, these air MasterCard, it's thie. You probably can't afford it, but we have an installment plan available to you, and we trust these affirm guys. They've done good for us. They will will treat you right. And so that sort of kicks off the relationship building process where they found out about us, and we are introduced to them under the umbrella of the brand who basically vouches for us. They wouldn't put us on the product page on the front page and sometimes in their email drops unless they thought were providing a good service. And interestingly enough, there's a sort of implicit indictment off the larger banks to do was known as point of sale issued credit cards, which is, you know, somewhere borderline evil product because they give you zero percent financing. Unless you missed the first payment. Which point becomes Maxim available? Most Max impossible by law compounding from the point of purchase. And it's kind of, ah, pretty awful product practically speaking. And those air very rarely promoted in giant print because merchants air vaguely embarrassed by them. They do driving parental volume so they are useful. But they're not exactly something I'm proud about, and we typically show up under the rubric of these guys air, not just good. They are the enabler there, the unlock her off a whole new segment in a market that typically couldn't afford this stuff. And so that's that. That's the sort of out of hand off point and absolutely critical portion of what we do. It requires that we hold ourselves to an incredibly high service standard on both sides of the equation. We can tell the merchant Hey, we'll do all these marvellous thanks for you will approve lots of people and then say, Actually, we're not. Nor can we tell the consumer, Here's your rate. It's pre calculated, will never change your interest and then do something else. So part of the difficulty or challenge of doing our business, we're constantly being held to a very high standard of service and, even more importantly, high standard of transparency. A big part of our trust building exercise is from the point of discovery. As the consumer says, Oh, yes, I would absolutely love to do an installment pay over the next twelve months. We have two instantaneously. Tell him you're approved, and here's how much. And here's your rating. Here's how many dollars and we're not just going to do all of this for you. We're going to start reminding you so you're not late and if you're late or not gonna charge you a late fee because that's our fault. We didn't remind you correctly, and when we made the under any decision, we made the choice to take you on as a risk and that that's we're going to have to stick with. So by sort of constantly aligning ourselves with consumers. Best interest is basically the way to play this on romantic. I mean, you can see that playing out in the old days. Other companies where you routinely just kind of branch through the decision tree, where uber or any one of these companies actually says what would be the consumer friendly, consumer intelligent thing to do<br/><br/>spk_1 (18m:9s) and building that trust over time especially important given, given the background well. And you can tell, too, from some of the stats with the firm, that customers are trying with smaller purchases, and then they often come back with larger and larger purchases. And you're building that trust overtime.<br/><br/>spk_2 (18m:24s) Yeah, one of the best ass we got is so typically a lot of persons that we make way underwrite to provide for R what they call consider purchase. These are a couple hundred dollars, but they're very lifestyle. Life change driven learns charm from somebody in the furniture business from home where his business interesting stat. When people are furnishing a house, they make eighty five percent of the purchase is that they will pour from that brand within forty five days of the middle point of the largest purchase. So essentially, this is incredibly concentrated set up, and it kind of makes it out of your mind. Abed. Well, you need some betting, and you need some towels and dishes because you're moving into your first apartment. And so what typically happens? People try us out and they borrow some amount of money at a merchant and they start paying off in You're like, Wow, it's all true. It is pre computed interest on their transparent, and I missed it by date. Nothing happened. The somebody called me and reminded me politely. And then I took care of it. And they thanked me and sent me a nice note. That was. And so as the kind of figure that wait a second, I have another thing I need to buy and that other thing. And I'm gonna go for the nicer one. So second person is eighty eight percent larger than the first one on average, and it doesn't necessarily mean the same merchant. So people kind of go. Where else can I use a firm so that that's been the trust establishment exercise has been working fairly well, given how we haven't been behaving.<br/><br/>spk_1 (19m:56s) All right, let's Ah, let's dive under the hood a little bit. You're known for lots of things, but one of the one of the most well known is just fraud at PayPal and world class fried fighting team, which really enabled papal toe grow into what it is today. And you've gotten some of the band back together. The farm. How you hear lots of different companies saying, We're going to look at your your Facebook friends what you ate for lunch? I'm exaggerating, but there's all sorts of different social signals and different things that you could bring in. How are you thinking about judging? What isn't isn't important. And how do we know? Like, Is it gonna work?<br/><br/>spk_2 (20m:33s) What so you don't? The honest answer is, you don't. And the only way of building a successful anti fraud and risk underwriting system is rigor. And like a better term balls of steel thie, they sound a little preposterous. But it's actually one of things that was and a priori at paper. Also, when we looked at our loss rates in the summer of two thousand, we were basically bleeding out millions of dollars in fraud related losses per week. We were basically running out of money, even though we had sixty million dollars in a bank, which was very strange. But how much time do we have left? Six weeks. How much money do we have? Fifty something million dollars that does not compute. But it does if you look at how much you're paying out to the various Eastern European mobsters. And so the thing that happened, though, is we had this unbelievable database off transactions gone bad, and you don't need to guess what. I will predict the outcome of transactions that go sour because he looked at your story database so long as you've done a good job blogging, you can then run the correlation. SEO. This thing predicts loss is much better than that thing, and you build a model around that knowledge. The most valuable data is not social data. Now Yuri for lunch, not even detain him. Ratio. You know that's fairly productive, but your own data because every data set that you're looking at internally describes your own process, including your bugs, including your delays, including what change, including the merchant base that he signed. An immersion base that turn all those changes to your system are encoded in your own logs and building models from your own data is the only way to build a really successful system because it's very hard to build models from your Indeed, if you don't have a lot of data and you're going to get a lot of data is to lose a bunch of money at PayPal, we learn that by way of going Holy crap. We already lost a bunch of money. In fact, we have lost so much we might be out of business any minute now. Quick, everyone work faster and we were able to escape the the unfortunate demise and came out better for it. And this guy, Nathan and I built a bunch of really cool systems, and then he went on to do some other exciting stuff. And when I started a firm, I called him up and said, Hey, I'm going to go do another one of these crazy things. This I'm going to be a little more careful about losing money But I learned the hard way last time. You have to pay tuition and it's expensive. But then you have this amazing data set that no one else has because it describes your system perfectly and say, If you're going to do it, let's get the band back together and he joined, and now he runs a risk. But the punch line is you only find out what works when you use the data that describes your own system, and that means crossing a lot of transactions and bracing for impact. Because a lot of the transactions are going to go sour. One of things that happens for a brand new launched credit card done right, you lose about fifty percent of the dollar volume in the first several months, which is terrifying because it's half the money literally.<br/><br/>spk_1 (23m:34s) So you're quoted as saying that we're trying to build a company that will serve customers for their lifetime. And now it affirm You can help me out. When I want to buy larger purchases, you've moved into student loans. I could imagine at some point I'm gonna want a mortgage. And now now I start to think of you as ah, a bank. So are you, Bank. Are you thinking you're gonna gonna become a bank, or how? How do you imagine? You want your customers to think about you in a few years?<br/><br/>spk_2 (24m:5s) You actually think bank in a few years? Well, probably not exist the way they are today. The purpose that the bank the banker used to fulfill a couple hundred years ago was that of a trusted advisor. A barely literate farmer would come to April banker and say, Hey, I got here a bag of gold that I have produced by the sweat of my brow, and I know it's money. Do something. Would that help me out on a banker would be a trusted advisor who would say, Hey, hues, bring it. We're goingto put this to work in a falling way, or we're going to save this be some sort of a structure that the farmer in the story would implicitly trust the banker to do. And at this point, we're actually trending towards sort of a extremely mechanical relationship with your existing banks because they just don't have time for you because they're efficiencies Air solo there. Still maintaining these of empty standing branches were theoretically, can go talk to a clerk behind the counter at a Wells Fargo branch, but they probably deal Dancer any sort of sophisticated question about your financial life. So the goal of a firm ultimately is not so much to be a better Wells Fargo or to beat City Bank at their own game. But to regain that trusted advisor relationship with the consumer, where today we're helping them bar responsibly so they know incentives are aligned. They're not going to get screwed by late fees or hidden fees or any sort of a charge they didn't expect in a long term twenty, thirty, fifty years from now. In addition to providing you with all the products you mentioned being a mortgage or car loan, we want to ultimately be in position to tell you Here's the smartest way to live your life financially and have the trust of the consumer to say, You know what I will by default? Basically, do what you think is right to say you know more about this stuff.<br/><br/>spk_1 (25m:52s) Lastly, on banks, you talk about how you think that they won't exist in the same form in years. Jamie Diamond, chairman of JPMorgan Chase, is now quite famously quoted as saying Silicon Valley is coming, and what he means by that is all the different start ups that are nibbling at different pieces of their business. How do you see banks potentially working with startups or and then specifically affirmed? You see yourself working with banks? One example. Some of the regional banks are partnering with lenders who would actually underwrite clients that those banks wouldn't be able to underwrite. And you see a synergy there. Yes,<br/><br/>spk_2 (26m:29s) I think there's no heat here. I'm very excited to partner. It was just about anybody. So long as they're good actor and actually in good faith. Large banks have certain mass efficiencies that are very far away in our future, and our not honestly core to our advantage. And their partnerships are fantastic and extremely appropriate. Something like cheap Morgan, for example, has or two trillion dollars in their asset management, and so they are unbelievably well connected. Source of capital, source of capital, relationships, placement, etcetera center. So there I imagine us working together more more with with companies like J. P. Morgan. The other thing that I think they hadn't people that are looking for yield are their national buyers off the loan portfolios that we create. And so in that sense, we're kind of the opposite of the too big to fail problems where we create these very carefully crafted loans, we care to align ourselves our customers. We make sure that we are reasonably well underwritten compared to sort of the let's just package all these things together. And, you know, if you truncheon enough, nothing's gonna happen until two thousand eight. So I think there's a lot of partnerships to be had on that front. Ah. Finally, I think the smarter ones of these banks kind of recognized that an impediment to there forays into the millennial demographic in particular is not lack of technology or lack of the right product. It's actually who they are. There's a fairly strong sense of. I don't want my bank to be blank, where blank is the top ten or top one hundred or whatever American banks and the young people are basically looking for. The service is the sort of financial advisor I think that I described perhaps. As a Azad most important piece of what they're trying to trying to get themselves into. And that cannot come from what Citibank represents to their parents. That that brand works fine for the parents That doesn't work for the kids. And so I think the opportunity for J. P. Morgan and the like is to partner with the young companies, like a firm to say what you<br/><br/>spk_3 (28m:59s) will be the<br/><br/>spk_2 (29m:1s) service, sir of these new generations. And we need to work together and participate in the yield participate in the market market services that you can't get two people. But ultimately, the relationship between us and our customers is something that is not really in competition was their opportunities. I don't believe the young people are actually listening when When those guys were talking and I don't mean that in the battery, I just I think that that's kind of the reality.<br/><br/>spk_1 (29m:28s) All right, I want to end on a totally different notes. You are rumored to have seen Akira Core Kurosawa's nineteen fifty for Seven Samurai. Something like one hundred and ten times.<br/><br/>spk_2 (29m:41s) That is an accurate statement.<br/><br/>spk_1 (29m:42s) Yes, s way have two questions. One, which Sam Roy are you? And two. Why? Why do you use this as a You show it to your management teams and what what is it about that that you're trying to drive home?<br/><br/>spk_2 (29m:56s) I think it's it's at this point. It's almost a metaphor. And so you can take something and turn it into a metaphor for something else. And the mapping is extremely loose. I saw it in college for the first time in film class, and I'm a huge of a Japan a file. And I love the culture. I love course of films. So it was kind of just one of the things that I knew I was going to like it in Washington, right at the same time I started running. My very first student group was the student chapter of Thie Special interest group for computer graphics, and the movie struck me as this very entertaining tale of a team being built. Bye. So I am obviously Gumby, which is the the the the guy who built the team, and he basically says, Well, I knew Build the team off. I think this sort of thing I need I need Elevens have a ride. But there's really no time. So we'll settle for nine like, Well, okay, the minimus seven. So they have six and they have this guy who is obviously not a samurai's kind of a joker. But you know what he shows as a samurai? So we're going to groom him into being a salary. We're going to need an army, but we don't really have an army. So we're going to go and train a bunch of peasants that don't really know how to fight. And they probably wanna run under pressure. But that doesn't matter. They'll be enough people there who so essentially, it's this kind of, ah building a start up in a war time for sort of life and death situation. And I when I I saw this, actually, I thought to myself, I need to use some of the ideas presented because the movie is literally black and white. But everything in it is black, and whites like this life and death situation. If they don't win, the bandits will kill them. And if they don't win this battle, the bandits will, you know, kill us, old lady and a baby. And so it's It's extremely black and White is itself a true heroic saga, and so I watched it to sort of figure out how to run an organization howto sort of build a team around myself. And then as I got into startups, I realized, Wait a second. I've seen this before. You know, the sort of a courage under fire. How do you discipline a team that is flailing like There's a great scene in there where he kind of figures out that he's having fear drive his team apart. People are essentially starting to kind of stop caring about the common good and run to their houses and to defend their families, even though it's very clear that if the bandits are allowed into the village, then it doesn't matter. If your house is your fortress, they're going to burn it down. And so he sort of basically is looking. What? Next time somebody runs away and it is order will be killed, like I'm going to personally murder you if you step off the line. And so this kind of extreme level of management by sword where you have to, you have to be part of the team because he committed to it. So<br/><br/>spk_0 (32m:59s) so that was<br/><br/>spk_2 (32m:59s) kind of Ah, at some point, I basically decided I'm going to keep watching this Well, because every time I watch it, there's a one more wrinkle of something interesting or amazing that I picked up. And then I realized that I spent so much time doing computer graphics and starting companies in college that I completely missed this notion of needing to do what's called a goal directed sequence at University of Illinois, which you can't really have a minor. So I have to take a bunch of classes that would've qualified for a minor. But you don't get a miner on your certificate anyway. So last two years, while I was wrapping up a little creative computer science stuff that I was doing, I also did East Asian literature and culture because I figured being a depend a file and watching lots of Japanese animation. And, of course, all movies should be ableto breece through most of the Japanese related content. That was exactly I was. It was right gamble and then the last said to get the sort of acidification of like, Yes, you completely go, Derek, that sequence you need to write a paper and paper had some obscene requirements, like twenty five pages, single spaced and was, like, supposed to be done over the course of a year, like a senior project type thing. And the cool thing about it was that you can pick any form of Asian art and right commentary on it. And it just needs to be sort of dialectic, where you have to be sort of very thoughtful about it, essentially for lack of a better term. And I said, Well, obviously is going to sound samurai because by then I already seated like twelve times from all of that because I'd watch it with my friend and saying They're hears. I think about this amazing movie and and then I realized they were two different translations, and I had to watch the other one that I thought the other was better side to watch a couple of times, and I got a little bit obsessed. But that basically, for this final paper, I said, I'm not really going bother writing is twenty five page paper. I don't have time for this, have to do something homework and computer science. But who's going to watch it every night, maybe twice a day until I memorize every part of this movie so that one day I'm going to sit down and write a twenty five page paper in one sort of fellow. And so I went up just watching it twice, three times a day. Sometimes I did watch it kind of watch. It fell asleep, watch it some more. And I didn't remember whether the VCR we started or not. My friends started giving me copies, became this sort of weird obsession. And then on the last day before the papers do, I sat down and started writing at ten PM that's sort of an A T m and got a plus on paper. So you work for five and then and I think that was like in the ease or nineties that I've seen it. And I started counting after I realize it's been like twenty five times I had the reason of the track. And then, after moved to Silicon Valley, I was lonely. So I watch it every once in a while, and then I started building a team of people, and I start watching it as a practical heat for building a team. And then it became a tradition. I just keep on watching.<br/><br/>spk_1 (35m:32s) Excellent. Hey. Well, thank you very much for joining us, Max.<br/><br/>spk_2 (35m:34s) Pleasure. Thank you.

      <td>Cabot Microelectronics Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, develops, manufactures, and sells polishing slurries and pads used in the manufacture of advanced integrated circuit (IC) devices in the semiconductor industry in a process called chemical mechanical planarization (CMP). The CMP technology is a polishing process used by IC device manufacturers to planarize or flatten the multiple layers of material that are deposited upon silicon wafers. The company offers CMP slurries, which are liquid solutions composed of high-purity deionized water, proprietary chemical additives, and engineered abrasives that chemically and mechanically interact with the surface material of the IC device at an atomic level; and CMP pads that are engineered polymeric materials designed to distribute and transport the slurry to the surface of the wafer and distribute it evenly across the wafer. Its CMP slurries are used for polishing various materials that conduct electrical signals, including tungsten, copper, tantalum, and aluminum; and certain materials that are used in the production of rigid disks and magnetic heads for hard disk drives, as well as used in the dielectric insulating materials that separate conductive layers within logic and memory IC devices. The company also designs and produces precision polishing and metrology systems to attain near-perfect shape and surface finish on various optical components, such as mirrors, lenses, and prisms. It serves the producers of logic IC devices or memory IC devices, and providers of IC foundry services directly, as well as through distributors. The company has a strategic collaboration with Fujimi Incorporated. It operates in the United States, Asia, and Europe.
